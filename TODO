Do not insert duplicate passords (filter on the admin side ?)
Create GTK interface (hum)
Update all ciphers
Move the password creation to a shared zone (for admin and client)
Restore old clients pruning, and fix all the problems that are related
Make the bob_admin work for something else than localhost

There should be bugs when many passwords are transfered.
