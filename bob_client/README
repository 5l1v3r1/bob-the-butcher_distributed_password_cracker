Bob the Butcher

Converting a JTR plugin to Bob:

* Change headers
* choose a unique format ID
* change fmt_tests to s_format_tests
* keep only the binary_hash and get_hash function that return a full byte
* the "binary" function must return a malloced buffer
* remove cmp_exact
* include usernames to password tests
* change fmt_main to s_format
* change the structure .. (do not forget the set_username)
